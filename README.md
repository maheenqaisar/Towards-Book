# Towards-Book

### TowardsBook-IOS-App

The main idea of the “Towards Book iOS app” is to show its readers the best books to read which helps them to grow their habit of reading books. Every good book opens up new dimensions of thoughts for the reader. 

The project consists of a list of Books displayed in various models and designs. The user may browse through these books as per categories. Any book that the user wishes to read, will be entered by him in the search box which works based on query input. The query may be an author name, the book name, or the subject to which the book is related, and will also work on specific keywords input. Apart from searching the books online, the user can save the book he/she likes in the favorites bar.

It has various fragments the homepage, profile page, favorites column, survey section which recommends books for the user by their personality type, and an option to sign out from the account recently logged in. We have abstracted the iOS application using the PHP API which supports us in enabling the various books to the users they are searching for.
